<h1 align="center">SUBU-AISET Autonomous Vehicles Team</h1>

## Who are we?

The Autonomous Vehicle team is part of the SUBU TETRA Community, which has been active since 2015.

#### Mission

Since 2021, we have been participating in the Autonomous Vehicle Competition within the scope of TeknoFest. Our goal is to complete the assigned task flawlessly, with sensitivity to the environment and traffic rules, without the need for human intervention.

#### Vision

With the advancement of technology and the development of corresponding hardware, our vision is to be environmentally friendly (electric) and to provide solutions to traffic problems (accidents, unresolved or insufficient road congestions, increased workforce). In this context, we aim to produce an original, national, and indigenous fully autonomous vehicle.

#### Description

Autonomous taxis are a project developed to address the increasing traffic accidents in recent years, promote better adherence to traffic rules, manage traffic congestion, and prevent the environmental harm caused by internal combustion vehicles. This innovative project aims to provide a safe and eco-friendly transportation alternative by utilizing autonomous technology.

### Solution

We utilize various hardware and software to perceive real-life problems much like a human and cope with these challenges effectively. Among these hardware components, LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs play a crucial role. Essentially, these components mimic human sensory organs, enabling the autonomous vehicle to perceive its surroundings. As a result, the autonomous vehicle can make decisions and generate solutions to problems much like a human. This approach minimizes error margins and allows the vehicle to make excellent decisions in many anticipated scenarios.
